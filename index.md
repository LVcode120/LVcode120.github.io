### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because it looked like a useful lab for the future.
    I used a 2d vector and was able to iterate through the list to give the population
    of the counties in California. It was also one of the first programs that I made
    with multiple files involved, such as a header file and a functions file.


* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious how games used randomness
    for a unique experience each time. Object-Oriented programs with their own algorithms are
    something that is defenitely important to learn as seen here with such a simple guessing game like
    Hi-Lo. Another reason why I liked this particular part was because I recall programming a guessing game
    similar to this one in python when I was in highschool.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I was curious on how I can create my own animated image.
    I was able to use loops, bools, vectors, and constant integers in order to create a moving image
    from 3 colors. Another thing that I liked about this part of the lab was how fluid the image turned
    out in the end, even though it was only 2 colors moving in seperate directions while the last color
    was just fading in and out.
